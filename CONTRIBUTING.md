# Contributing

Thank you for considering a contribution to this project! Here's how to get started.

## Getting started

1. **Fork** the repository
2. **Clone** your fork
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/traditional-rag-pipeline.git
   cd traditional-rag-pipeline
   ```
3. **Create a branch** for your change
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Install dependencies**

## Making changes

- Keep changes focused — one feature or fix per pull request
- Follow the existing code style (no framework magic, explicit over implicit)
- Test your changes manually before opening a PR
- Update the README if you change any configuration options or behaviour

## Opening a pull request

1. Push your branch to your fork
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
2. Open a pull request against `main`
3. Fill in the PR template — describe what you changed and why
4. Wait for review

## Reporting bugs

Use the [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) and include:
- What you expected to happen
- What actually happened
- Steps to reproduce
- Your OS, Python version, and Ollama model

## Suggesting features

Use the [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md) and explain the use case clearly.

## Code of conduct
